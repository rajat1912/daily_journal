Simple blog website created using Node.js , EJS template and MongoDB

INTRODUCTION
I created this project to get hands-on experience on Node.js and how it is like to be working with MongoDB.
I have also made use of EJS template.

FUNCTIONALITIES
This website has a home page with authorisation( i.e. Login and Regiser).
To read a whole blog post , one needs to be logged in.
Only logged in users can add a new post.
Then there is EJS templates used to look up for "about" and "contact" page.
All the blog posts are stored in the database using MongoDB.
